title: About this website
---

This website is just a bunch of sample stuff to show you what you can do in **PieCrust**. But other than that,
there's not much to it -- I mean, you can probably see that this content is pretty useless.

Oh, by the way, don't forget to read the [documentation] so you can replace all those pages with your own.
